# BodyPoseDetection
**Basic setup for detecting human body poses in swift**

With new Vision APIs for iOS 14, you can detect human body poses. This project has a basic setup for:

1) reading video frames from a camera
2) processing frames and calling the detect human body pose API
3) parsing out human body poses and drawing them on screen
